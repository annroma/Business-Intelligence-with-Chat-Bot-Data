# Business Intelligence & Chatbots: Examining British Airway's Twitter
This is Anna here - welcome to my repository! In collaboration with Open Avenues and Businessolver, I have created this archive to show how you can move from dirty, non-standardized data to targeted KPIs all with the power of Python and pandas/matplotlib.

The code is designed to move from broad to specific, so feel free to adopt the early code and improvise in later stages.

My purported goal for this data: Gather information on British Airway's hourly conversation rate, an indicator of engagement.

Join me, and let's get started!
